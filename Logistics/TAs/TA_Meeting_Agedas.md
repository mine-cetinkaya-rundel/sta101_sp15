Sta 101 TA Meeting Agendas
===========================

#### Dr. Cetinkaya-Rundel & Dr. Windle
#### Spring 2015

### Week 1: Jan 12, 2015

* Reschedule Week 2 meeting (Jan 19 is a holiday) - Jan 19 at noon
* Go over Lab 1

### Week 2: Jan 19, 2015

* Based on feedback on student experience in Lab 1, start Lab 2 reminding students of the following:
    + R code always follows the format `function(what to apply the function to)`, the function is always a verb, and in the parentheses we have what that function should be applied to, as well as sometimes additional parameters (options) for the function.
    + To refer to a variable always use `data$variable`, don't forget about the `$`
    + Go through the markdown file once with the students, and show them what happens in and outside the code chunk. This can be demonstrated by writing a simple function like `5+4` in and outside the code chunk. When you compile they'll see that the statement is calculated if included in the chunk, and rendered as plain text if not. Also remind them how to add chunks when they need them. And the motto **knit early, and often!**, if they do a bunch of work and then knit and there's an issue it'll be hard to find the source of the error. Knitting after every exercise is good practice.
* Feedback from PS1 - include in lecture slides: 
    + Confusion over random sampling as a requirement for causality -- Remind students random sampling -> generalizability, random assignment -> causality.
    + Confusion over cluster sampling as opposed to convenience sampling -- remind students we covered 3 (good) methods of sampling and there are other methods to (convenience, volunteer, etc.), they just happen to be not so good methods
* Mine to send TAs standard text to be used for requesting PDF submission from students who submitted Word document. Going forward Word submission (or other not allowed format) -> 0 on PS.
