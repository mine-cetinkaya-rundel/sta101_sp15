\ttl{Application exercise \appno{}: \\
Randomization testing}

\inst{Submit your responses on \Sakai{}, under the appropriate assignment. Only one submission per team is required. One team will be randomly selected and their responses will be discussed.}

Student-to-faculty ratio data collected from random samples of public and private four-year colleges:

\begin{multicols}{2}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{l | c | c}
\hline
		& $public$	& $private$ \\
\hline
$mean$	& 18		& 14 \\
\hline
$sd$		& 4.6		& 7.3 \\
\hline
$n$		& 57		& 85 \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{ratio/ratio_box}
\end{center}
\end{multicols}

\begin{enumerate}

\item We would like to test if there is a \emph{difference} between the average student-to-faculty ratio between public and private four-year colleges using a randomization test. What are the hypotheses?

\item Fill in the blanks below for the appropriate set up for this test:

\begin{doublespace}
We write the student-to-faculty ratio of each public and private college in this sample on a total of \rule{2cm}{0.5pt} index cards. Then, we shuffle these cards and split them into two groups: one group of size \rule{2cm}{0.5pt} representing public colleges, and another group of size \rule{2cm}{0.5pt} representing private colleges. We calculate the difference between the average student-to-faculty ratios in the public and private colleges ($\bar{x}_{public} - \bar{x}_{private}$) and record this value. We repeat this many times to build a randomization distribution, which should be centered at \rule{2cm}{0.5pt} . Lastly, we calculate the p-value as the proportion of simulations where the simulated differences in means are \rule{2cm}{0.5pt}.
\end{doublespace}

\item The dot plot below is created using 100 simulations. What is the p-value?

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{ratio/rand_dist}
\end{center}

\item Based on the p-value, do these data provide convincing evidence to suggest that the student-to-faculty ratio in public four-year colleges is different than that of private four-year  colleges.

\end{enumerate}
