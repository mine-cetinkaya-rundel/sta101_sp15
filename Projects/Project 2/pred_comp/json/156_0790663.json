One new applicant causes astonishment when he knocks on the door of the school. He is Maruge (Oliver Litondo), an old Mau Mau veteran in his eighties, who is desperate to learn to read at this late stage of his life. He fought for the liberation of his country and now feels he must have the chance of an education so long denied - even if it means sitting in a classroom alongside six-year-olds. Moved by his passionate plea, head teacher Jane Obinchu (Naomie Harris), supports his struggle to gain admission and together they face fierce opposition from parents and officials who don't want to waste a precious school place on such an old man. -- (C) Official Site","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/LnltVyez4Qa1btkOB5oYHwIwemw=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/71/11157159_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/LnltVyez4Qa1btkOB5oYHwIwemw=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/71/11157159_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/LnltVyez4Qa1btkOB5oYHwIwemw=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/71/11157159_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/LnltVyez4Qa1btkOB5oYHwIwemw=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/71/11157159_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Naomie Harris","id":"162705781","characters":["Jane Obinchu"]},{"name":"Oliver Litondo","id":"770949081","characters":["Kimani Ng'ang'a Maruge"]},{"name":"Tony Kgoroge","id":"528345122","characters":["Charles Obinchu"]},{"name":"Shoki Mokgapa","id":"771103751","characters":["Teacher Elizabeth"]},{"name":"Nick Reding","id":"770725251","characters":["Officer Johnson"]}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"Justin Chadwick"}],"studio":"National Geographic Entertainment","alternate_ids":{"imdb":"0790663"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id=0790663","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_first_grader/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771208470/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771208470/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771208470/similar.json","canonical":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771208470.json"},"link_template":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id={alias-id}"}
