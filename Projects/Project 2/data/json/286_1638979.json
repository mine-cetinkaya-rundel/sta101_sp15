Nearly one million copies are sold each year and the novel has been translated into more than forty languages worldwide. The film version, starring Gregory Peck as Atticus Finch, won a trio of Academy Awards, and the U.S. Postal Service's new stamp honoring Peck depicts him wearing glasses, as Finch. Behind it all was a young Southern girl named Nelle Harper Lee, who once said that she wanted to be South Alabama's Jane Austen. Hey, Boo explores Lee's life and unravels some of the mysteries surrounding her, including why she never published again. Containing never-before-seen photos and letters and an exclusive interview with Lee's sister, Alice Finch Lee, the film also brings to light the context and history of the novel's Deep South setting and the social changes it inspired after publication. Oprah Winfrey, Tom Brokaw, Anna Quindlen, Rosanne Cash, Wally Lamb, Richard Russo, Scott Turow, Andrew Young and others reflect on the novel's power, influence, and popularity, and the many ways it has shaped their lives. --(c) First Run Features","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/3bqeKMikHia9iUDWiqVNdRCPkZc=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/71/11157122_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/3bqeKMikHia9iUDWiqVNdRCPkZc=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/71/11157122_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/3bqeKMikHia9iUDWiqVNdRCPkZc=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/71/11157122_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/3bqeKMikHia9iUDWiqVNdRCPkZc=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/71/11157122_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Jennifer Laird White","id":"771103779","characters":["Voice"]},{"name":"Jane Beasley","id":"771103780","characters":["Voice"]},{"name":"Bob Mayer","id":"771103781","characters":["Voice"]},{"name":"Christopher Seward","id":"771103782","characters":["Voice"]},{"name":"Donna Coney Island","id":"771103783","characters":["Voice"]}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"Mary Murphy"},{"name":"Mary McDonagh Murphy"}],"studio":"First Run Features","alternate_ids":{"imdb":"1638979"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id=1638979","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/hey_boo_harper_lee_and_to_kill_a_mockingbird/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771208886/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771208886/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771208886/similar.json","canonical":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771208886.json"},"link_template":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id={alias-id}"}
