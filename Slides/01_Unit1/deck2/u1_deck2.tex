- this is from your survey, though not for everyone from both classes.

- is there anything out of the ordinary about this?  you probably were first
kissed when you were a baby, but it isn't clear what we are talking about.

- so this is an example of how we need to be careful how we phrase a question.
we want to phrase it so that there is only one interpretation.

\frametitle{Describing distributions of numerical variables}

\begin{itemize}

\item \hl{Shape}: skewness, modality

\item \hl{Center}: an estimate of a \hl{typical} observation in the distribution (mean, median, mode, etc.) 
\begin{itemize}
\item Notation: $\mu$: population mean, $\bar{x}$: sample mean
\end{itemize}

\item \hl{Spread}: measure of variability in the distribution (standard deviation, IQR, range, etc.)

\item \hl{Unusual observations}: observations that stand out from the rest of the data that may be suspected outliers

\end{itemize}

%---Note---%
\note{

  Always talk about shape, center, spread, etc.

  Shape

  What do I mean by modality: promenent peaks.

  When talking about center, what is most common measure of center: mean

  What else: median.

  Mode is also used, though it isn't always that useful.  It is the most
  frequent observation.  But it is sometimes hard to determine what that is when
  working with continuous numerical data.

  Just a note for notation: $\mu$ or any greek letter denotes a pop. param.
  $\mu$ is pop bar.

  xbar is a sample statistic.  Often times we want to know mu, but we don't have
  pop, so we caompute xbar and call that best guess.

  how can we put some uncertainty around best guess to refelect that this comes
  from sample and not whole pop.

  when we talk about spread we are talking about variability in the distrbution.

  unusual observations.  sometimes people just remove outliers.  you should not
  do that unless you have good reason to do so, they may convey important information.

\frametitle{Standard deviation and variance}

\begin{itemize}

\item Most commonly used measure of variability is the \hl{standard deviation}, which roughly measures the average deviation from the mean
\begin{itemize}
\item Notation: $\sigma$: population standard deviation, $s$: sample standard deviation
\end{itemize}

\item Calculating the standard deviation, for a population (rarely, if ever) and for a sample:

\[ \darkgray{$\sigma = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i = 1}^N (x_i - \mu)^2}{n}}$} \qquad s = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i = 1}^n (x_i - \bar{x})^2}{n - 1}} \]

\item Square of the standard deviation is called the \hl{variance}.

\end{itemize}

%---Note---%
\note{

spread.  here we are going to go about standard deviation.

one of the more tedious computations.

it roughly measures the average deviation from the mean.

we want to think about how far or how close the data are from the mean on
average.

notation: sigma, greek population standard devaition.  s: sample standard
deviation.

gray here is population data, we rarely have this.

a couple things: used square.  and divide by $n-1$.

why use squares.

standard deviation is nice because it is the same units as what you measure.

\pause

Lose a ``degree of freedom" for using an estimate (the sample mean, $\bar{x}$), in estimating the sample variance/standard deviation.

\pause

$\:$ \\

\disc{Why do we use the squared deviation in the calculation of variance?}

\pause

\begin{itemize}
\item To get rid of negatives so that observations equally distant from the mean are weighed equally.
\item To weigh larger deviations more heavily.
\end{itemize}

%---Note---%
\note{

why divide by $n-1$ instead of $n$?

go back.  comopare equations.  ideally use population mean.  this introduces
extra uncertatiny.  for that we need to penalize ourselves.

if i divide by $n-1$ or $n$ which yields a higher value?  if i divide by
something smaller, I get a larger number.

so we are in effect reporting a larger estimate of the standard deviation.  this
is conservative.

go forward.  why square things?  what happens if we add a positive and a
negative number?  they cancel out.

one reaons, you don't want poitives and negatives to cancle.

what would be a more intuitive way?

abs.

what does square do?  it weights larger deviations more heavily?

\label{mi3}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Robust statistics}

\begin{itemize}

\item Mean and standard deviation are easily affected by extreme observations since the value of each data point contributes to their calculation.

\item Median and IQR are more robust.

\item Therefore we choose median\&IQR (over mean\&SD) when describing skewed distributions.

\end{itemize}

%---Note---%
\note{

median and iqr are robust.  this is why use them do describe skewed
distribution.

which is more informative for skewed distribution?

when describing dist, first think about shape, then think about numbers to use
to describe.

it is on you to get an idea on visualization and then pick.
