\subsection{Use a sample to make inferences about the population}
\label{mi1}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{1. Use a sample to make inferences about the population}

\begin{itemize}[<+->]
\item Our ultimate goal is to make inferences about populations

\item However populations are difficult or impossible to access

\item Therefore we use a sample from that population, and use \hl{statistics} from that sample to make inferences about the unknown population \hl{parameters}
\begin{itemize}
\item We want to know how many offspring female lemurs have, on average
\item It's not feasible to obtain offspring data from on all female lemurs, so we use data from the Duke Lemur Center
\item We use the sample mean from these data as an estimate for the unknown population mean
\end{itemize}

\item The better (more \hl{representative}) sample we have, the more reliable our estimates and more accurate our inferences will be

\end{itemize}

\pause

\disc{Can you see any limitations to using data from the Duke Lemur Center to make inferences about all lemurs?}

\frametitle{Sampling is natural}

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]{figures/soup}
\end{center}

\begin{itemize}

\item When you taste a spoonful of soup and decide the spoonful you tasted isn't salty enough, that's \hl{exploratory analysis}

\item If you generalize and conclude that your entire soup needs salt, that's an \hl{inference}

\item For your inference to be valid, the spoonful you tasted (the sample) needs to be \hl{representative} of the entire pot (the population)

\end{itemize}

\end{center}

\begin{itemize}
\item \hl{Simple random sampling:} Randomly select cases from the population, each case is equally likely to be selected

\item \hl{Stratified sampling:} First divide the population into homogenous \hl{strata}, then randomly sample from \underline{each} stratum
\begin{itemize}
\item e.g. Stratify to control for socio-economic status
\end{itemize}

\item \hl{Cluster sampling:} First randomly sample \underline{a few} clusters, then randomly sample from within them
\begin{itemize}
\item \hl{Clusters} are not necessarily homogenous, but ideally they're not too different from each other
\item e.g. First sample a few schools from a school district, and then only sample students from within those schools
\item Usually preferred for economical reasons
\end{itemize}

\clicker{A city council has requested a household survey be conducted in a suburban area of their city.

\item Simple random sampling
\item Stratified sampling, where each cluster is a neighborhood

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{3. Sampling schemes can suffer from a variety of biases}

\begin{itemize}[<+->]

\item \hl{Non-response:} If only a small fraction of the randomly sampled people choose to respond to a survey, the sample may no longer be representative of the population

\item \hl{Voluntary response:} Occurs when the sample consists of people who volunteer to respond because they have strong opinions on the issue since such a sample will also not be representative of the population

\item \hl{Convenience sample:} Individuals who are easily accessible are more likely to be included in the sample

Of these 1,200 surveys that were completed, 960 agreed with the policy change and 240 disagreed. Which of the following statements are true?}

\begin{enumerate}[I.]
\item Some of the mailings may have never reached the parents.
\item Overall, the school district has strong support from parents to move forward with the policy approval.
\item It is possible that majority of the parents of high school students disagree with the policy change.
\item The survey results are unlikely to be biased because all parents were mailed a survey.

\item Treatment: increased stress
\item Control: no or baseline stress

\item It is suspected that the effect of stress might be different on younger and older people: \hl{block} for age.
