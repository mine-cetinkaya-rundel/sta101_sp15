\subsection{Binomial distribution is used for calculating the probability of exact number of successes for a given number of trials}

\begin{itemize}
\item Each person in the poll be thought of as a \hl{trial}
\pause
\item A person is labeled a \hl{success} if s/he has high-speed broadband connection at home, \hl{failure} if not
\pause
\item Since 70\% have high-speed broadband connection at home, \hl{probability of success} is \hl{p = 0.70}
\end{itemize}

\frametitle{Considering many scenarios}

\disc{Suppose we randomly select three individuals from the US, what is the probability that exactly 1 has high-speed broadband connection at home?}
\pause
Let's call these people Anthony (A), Barry (B), Cam (C). Each one of the three scenarios below will satisfy the condition of ``exactly 1 of them says Yes": \\
\vspace{0.25cm}
\pause
\begin{changemargin}{+1.5cm}{+0cm}
{\footnotesize
\begin{enumerate}
\item[Scenario 1:] $\slot{0.70}{\text{(A) \red{yes}}} \times \slot{0.30}{\text{(B) not yes}} \times \slot{0.30}{\text{(C) not yes}} \approx 0.063$
\pause
\item[Scenario 2:]  $\slot{0.30}{\text{(B) not yes}} \times \slot{0.70}{\text{(A) \red{yes}}} \times \slot{0.30}{\text{(C) not yes}} \approx 0.063$
\pause
\item[Scenario 3:]  $\slot{0.30}{\text{(B) not yes}} \times \slot{0.30}{\text{(C) not yes}} \times \slot{0.70}{\text{(A) \red{yes}}} \approx 0.063$
\end{enumerate}
}
\end{changemargin}
\pause
The probability of exactly one 1 of 3 people saying Yes is the sum of all of these probabilities.
\[ 0.063 + 0.063 + 0.063 = 3 \times 0.063 = 0.189 \]

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Binomial distribution}

The question from the prior slide asked for the probability of given number of successes, \mathhl{k}, in a given number of trials, \mathhl{n}, ($k = 1$ success in $n = 3$ trials), and we calculated this probability as
\[ \#~of~scenarios \times P(single~scenario) \]

\pause

\begin{itemize}

\item $P(single~scenario) = p^k~(1-p)^{(n-k)}$ \\
{\tiny probability of success to the power of number of successes, probability of failure to the power of number of failures}

\pause

\item number of scenarios: ${n \choose k} = \frac{n!}{k! (n - k)!}$

\end{itemize}

\pause
$\:$ \\

The \hl{Binomial distribution} describes the probability of having exactly $k$ successes in $n$ independent trials (with only two possible outcomes) with probability of success $p$.

\frametitle{Expected value and standard deviation of binomial}

\disc{According to the results of the Pew poll suggestion that 70\% of Americans have high-speed broadband connection at home, among a random sample of 100 Americans, how many would you expect to have such connection at home?}

\pause

\begin{itemize}

\item Easy enough, $100 \times 0.70 = 70$
\pause
\begin{itemize}
\item Or more formally, $\mu = np = 100 \times 0.44 = 44$
\end{itemize}

\pause

\item But this doesn't mean in every random sample of 100 Americans exactly 70 will have high-speed broadband connection at home. In some samples there will be fewer of those, and in others more. How much would we expect this value to vary?
\pause
\begin{itemize}
\item $\sigma = \sqrt{np(1-p)} = \sqrt{100 \times 0.70 \times 0.30} \approx  4.58$
\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\Note{Mean and standard deviation of a binomial might not always be whole numbers, and that is alright, these values represent what we would expect to see on average.}
