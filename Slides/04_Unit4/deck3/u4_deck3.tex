Null hypothesis for "F-Test" (the test associated with ANOVA):
\[
H_0: \mu_{\textmd{placebo}} = \mu_{\textmd{purple}} = \mu_{\textmd{brown}} =
\ldots = \mu_{\textmd{peach}} = \mu_{\textmd{orange}} .

  hypothesis?}

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item For any two groups, including the placebo group, no two group means are the same.
\item For any two groups, not including the placebo group, no two group means are the
  same.
\item Amongst the jelly bean groups, there are at least two groups that have different group means.
\item \solnMultOn{2}{3}{Amongst all groups, there are at least two groups that have different group means.}

The practical implication of this alternative is: ``At least one color of
jelly bean is linked to acne.''

\pause

\hfill \\

At least two of the group means are not the same: \pause
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\mu_{\textmd{placebo}} \neq \mu_{\textmd{color}}$ for some color of jelly
  bean, or \pause
\item $\mu_{\textmd{A}} \neq \mu_{\textmd{B}}$ for two colors, A and B. \pause

Then 

\vspace{3pt}

\begin{enumerate}
\item $\mu_{\textmd{A}} \neq \mu_{\textmd{placebo}}$, or \pause

\item $\mu_{\textmd{A}} = \mu_{\textmd{placebo}}$.  Thus, $\mu_{\textmd{B}} \neq
