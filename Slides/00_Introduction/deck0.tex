{\footnotesize
\begin{itemize}[<alert@+>]
\item Recognize the importance of data collection, identify limitations in data collection methods, and determine how they affect the scope of inference.
\item Use statistical software to summarize data numerically and visually, and to perform data analysis.
\item Have a conceptual understanding of the unified nature of statistical inference.
\item Apply estimation and testing methods to analyze single variables or the relationship between two variables in order to understand natural phenomena and make data-based decisions.
\item Model numerical response variables using a single or multiple explanatory variables.
\item Interpret results correctly, effectively, and in context without relying on statistical jargon.
\item Critique data-based claims and evaluate data-based decisions.
\item Complete two research projects: one that focuses on statistical inference and one that focuses on modeling.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Other policies}

\frametitle{Academic Dishonesty}

Any form of academic dishonesty will result in an immediate 0 on the given assignment and will be reported to the Office of Student Conduct. Additional penalties may also be assessed if deemed appropriate. If you have any questions about whether something is or is not allowed, ask me beforehand.

Some examples:

\begin{itemize}

\item Use of disallowed materials (including any form of communication with classmates or accessing the web) during exams and readiness assessments

\item Plagiarism of any kind

\item Use of outside answer keys or solution manuals for the homework

\end{itemize}

\frametitle{Tips for success}

{\footnotesize
\begin{itemize}[<alert@+>]
\item Complete the reading before a new unit begins, and then review again after the unit is over.
\item Be an active participant during lectures and labs.
\item Ask questions - during class or office hours, or by email. Ask me, your TAs, and your classmates.
\item Do the problem sets - start early and make sure you attempt and understand all questions.
\item Start your projects early and and allow adequate time to complete them.
\item Give yourself plenty of time time to prepare a good cheat sheet for exams. This requires going through the material and taking the time to review the concepts that you're not comfortable with.
\item Do not procrastinate - don't let a unit go by with unanswered questions as it will just make the following unit's material even more difficult to follow. 
\end{itemize}
}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{To do}

\begin{itemize}

\item Download or purchase the textbook

\end{itemize}

\item Complete the pretest and survey

\item Read the syllabus and let me know if you have any questions

\item One of your first tasks in this class is to help design a survey. This survey will be completed \emph{anonymously}. It will (ideally) have information on \emph{variables you are interested in}. When writing your question consider whether you would feel comfortable answering it on an anonymous survey.

\item Work with 3-4 classmates to come up with a survey question, and add it to Google Doc linked below. Make sure that the wording of the question is clear, and (if categorical) the answer choices make sense.
\begin{center}
\webURL{http://bit.ly/sta101sp15_ClassSurvey}
\end{center}

\item Before adding a question check to make sure that it hasn’t already been added. If your question is already there, but you can suggest a clearer / better wording, add it as ``alternative wording" underneath the original question.
