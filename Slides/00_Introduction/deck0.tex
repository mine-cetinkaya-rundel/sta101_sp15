{\footnotesize
\begin{itemize}[<alert@+>]
\item Recognize the importance of data collection, identify limitations in data collection methods, and determine how they affect the scope of inference.
\item Use statistical software to summarize data numerically and visually, and to perform data analysis.
\item Have a conceptual understanding of the unified nature of statistical inference.
\item Apply estimation and testing methods to analyze single variables or the relationship between two variables in order to understand natural phenomena and make data-based decisions.
\item Model numerical response variables using a single or multiple explanatory variables.

\item Critique data-based claims and evaluate data-based decisions.

\item Clickers may not be shared, and the clicker registered to a person may only be used by that person, failure to abide by this will result in a 0 clicker grade for everyone involved

\item Use of disallowed materials (textbook, class notes, web references, any form of communication with classmates or other persons, etc.) during exams will not be tolerated

\frametitle{Academic Dishonesty}

Any form of academic dishonesty will result in an immediate 0 on the given assignment and will be reported to the Office of Student Conduct. Additional penalties may also be assessed if deemed appropriate. If you have any questions about whether something is or is not allowed, ask me beforehand.

Some examples:

\begin{itemize}

\item Use of disallowed materials (including any form of communication with classmates or accessing the web) during exams and readiness assessments

\item Plagiarism of any kind

\item Use of outside answer keys or solution manuals for the homework

\begin{itemize}[<alert@+>]
\item Complete the reading before a new unit begins, and then review again after the unit is over.
\item Be an active participant during lectures and labs.
\item Ask questions - during class or office hours, or by email. Ask me, your TAs, and your classmates.
\item Do the problem sets - start early and make sure you attempt and understand all questions.
\item Start your projects early and and allow adequate time to complete them.
\item Give yourself plenty of time time to prepare a good cheat sheet for exams. This requires going through the material and taking the time to review the concepts that you're not comfortable with.
\item Do not procrastinate - don't let a unit go by with unanswered questions as it will just make the following unit's material even more difficult to follow.

  \begin{itemize}
    \item Name is just one piece of information.
    \item It is often interesting to look at two pieces of information together. What if we combine name and year?
    \item Is anyone familiar with 538?  What is it?
    \item Nate Silver started this blog back in the 2008 election of Obama vs. McCain.  538 refers to the number of votes in the electoral college.  Since then it has branched out into all sorts of ``data news''.
    \item This article... How to Tell Someone's age... tries to figure out what we can tell about someone's age, given their name.
    \item If I told you that you were about to meet Gertrude, what would you guess her age to be?  60, 70?
    \item You can use SSD data and actuarial tables, which tell you about how long someone is going to live to figure out the distribution of ages for a given name.

  \item Here we have a plot of names, their interquartile ranges, and the their medians.
  \item Basically we have a data set in which each observation is the name of an individual and her age.
  \item Does anyone know what a percentile is?
  \item There are actually a couple definitions of percentile.
  \item All of them ultimately have to do with expressing how many observations in our data set our below a certain threshold.
  \item We take all the Anna's and order them by age from youngest to oldest.
  \item We then look at the cutoff age for a certain fraction of the observations.
  \item For the name Anna, the 25th percentile is 14 years.
  \item That means that 25\% of the Anna's are 14 years of age or younger.
  \item For the name Anna, the 75th percentile is 62 years.
  \item That means that 75\% of the Anna's are 62 years of age or younger.
  \item The median is the 50\% percentile.
  \item 50\% of Anna's are 31 years of age or younger.
  \item Women of wisdom.

  \item Is anyone here from the New York Region?  What is this a map of?
  \item This image was created using data from Flickr, which is where people posted pictures before instagram and Facebook.
  \item Along with the pictures and geotagging info, there is text posted by the photographer.
  \item Based on that text we can categorize the photographer as a tourist or native.
  \item Where are the tourists hanging out? Broadway, Times Square, South Street Port
  \item Where are the locals: anywhere but Times Square.  At home.
  \item Staten Island is a crap shoot.
  \item Why are there no pictures in the upper middle right?  Riker prison.  You can't take pictures in prison.
  \item Why is this data useful: targetted marketing.  Serve up adds based on WHO you are and WHERE you are.

    \setlength{\parskip}{0pt}
\item One of your first tasks in this class is to help design a survey. This survey will be completed \emph{anonymously}. It will (ideally) have information on \emph{variables you are interested in}. When writing your question consider whether you would feel comfortable answering it on an anonymous survey.

\item Work with 3-4 classmates to come up with a survey question, and add it to Google Doc linked below. Make sure that the wording of the question is clear, and (if categorical) the answer choices make sense.
\begin{center}
\webURL{http://bit.ly/sta101sp15_ClassSurvey}
\end{center}

\item Before adding a question check to make sure that it hasn't already been added. If your question is already there, but you can suggest a clearer / better wording, add it as ``alternative wording'' underneath the original question.
\end{itemize}
}

%---Note---%
\note{

  \begin{itemize}
    \item Work in informal teams of 3-4.
    \item Go over examples of types of questions.
    \item Come up with questions.
    \item Do not put questions you (or another) would be uncomfortable answering.
    \item But try to keep the questions interesting.
    \item We will try to compile a set of reasonable questions for you all to answer.
    \item You will fill out the survey and then we will use that data for examples during the semester.
