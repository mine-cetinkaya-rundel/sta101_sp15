The textbook is freely [available online](http://www.openintro.org/stat/textbook.php). You're welcomed to read on screen or print it out. If you prefer a paperback version you can buy it at the cost of printing (under $10) [on Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/dp/1478217200). The textbook store will not carry copies of this text.

* Clicker: [i>clicker2](http://www.amazon.com/I-Clicker-2-I-Clicker/dp/1429280476) (ISBN: 1429280476) \\
If you would like to purchase a used clicker from a former student, see the list of students selling their clickers [at this Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AkY2lFgS9uiDdE1fMkZUZnp6alJDSG9tYlIwTFJWdnc#gid=0). You can contact them directly, or leave your name on the list under "Wants to buy clicker". The clickers will also be available at the Duke textbook store, or you can get them for slightly cheaper [on Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/I-Clicker-2-I-Clicker/dp/1429280476). Note that this is i>clicker2, and not i>clicker+.
